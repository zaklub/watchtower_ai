Table Classification Within Group - Second level intent classification
Determines which specific table within a group should handle the query, or if it should use analytics

ENHANCED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM:
- MONITOR_GROUP: Basic monitor tables + Analytics
- FACTS_GROUP: Event data tables + Analytics  
- RULES_GROUP: Three-level classification system:
  1. Level 1: Group Classification (RULES_GROUP)
  2. Level 2: Data Type Classification (CURRENT_DATA vs HISTORICAL_DATA)
  3. Level 3: Table/Analytics Classification:
     - CURRENT_DATA: MONITOR_RULES, RULES_DEFINITIONS, RULES_ACTIONS, ACTION_EXECUTORS, or Analytics
     - HISTORICAL_DATA: MONITOR_RULES_LOGS or Analytics
     - Analytics classification is handled within each data type function
- ACTIONS_GROUP: Action tables + Analytics

KEY DISTINCTION:
- CURRENT_DATA = What rules are configured to do NOW (current settings, configurations, available actions, rule SQL/logic definitions)

CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES:

1. CURRENT_DATA - Use for queries about current/static information:
   - Current rule status, configuration, and settings
   - Rule definitions, logic, and SQL queries
   - Rule evaluation criteria and conditions
   - Current action configurations and what actions are available
   - Available action types and executors
   - Current violation status of rules (which rules are currently violated)
   - Examples: "show rules", "rule status", "rule configuration", "enabled rules", "active rules", "violated rules", "which rules are violated", "give me rules that are currently violated", "available actions", "action types", "rules whose actions are EMAIL", "rule SQL", "rule logic", "rule definition"

2. HISTORICAL_DATA - Use for queries about time-based events and history:
   - Rule violation history and audit trails
   - Past rule evaluations and results
   - Channel-specific events and notifications (EMAIL, SLACK, SMS, PAGERDUTY, OPSGENIE)
   - Examples: "rule history", "violation logs", "events for Channel EMAIL", "SLACK notifications", "what happened when", "show me events"

DECISION LOGIC:
